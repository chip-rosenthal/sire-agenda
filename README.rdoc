This library provides an interface to the Sire agenda management system,
such as used by the City of Austin.

It's currently in development. Drop me a line if you'd like to help.

Example:

    @sire = SireAgenda.new

    upcoming_meetings = @sire.list_meetings

    agenda = {}
    upcoming_meetings.keys.each do |meetid|
        doc = @sire.get_agenda(meetid)
        agenda[meetid] = @sire.parse_agenda(meetid, doc)
    end
